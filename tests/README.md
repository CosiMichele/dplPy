# Tucson Files

Three Tucson format decadal raw ring width (`.rwl`) data are currently available in `./tests/data/` - these were selected because they are also part of the [dplR package](https://github.com/andybunn/dplR).  These include the following: 

- wa082.rwl - This data set gives the raw ring widths for Pacific silver fir *Abies amabilis* at Hurricane Ridge in Washington, USA.  The complete original data are available [here from the ITRDB](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/treering/measurements/northamerica/usa/wa082.rwl)

- ca533.rwl - This data set gives the raw ring widths for bristlecone pine *Pinus longaeva* at Campito Mountain in California, USA.  The complete original data are available [here from the ITRDB](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/treering/measurements/northamerica/usa/ca533.rwl)

- co021.rwl - This data set gives the raw ring widths for Douglas fir *Pseudotsuga menziesii* at Mesa Verde in Colorado, USA. The complete original data are available [here from the ITRDB](https://www1.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/paleo/treering/measurements/northamerica/usa/co021.rwl)

Comma-delimited (`.csv`) versions of the above Tucson-formatted files are also in this directory.  The CSV files were converted from the original RWL files using the DPL subprogram YUX.
